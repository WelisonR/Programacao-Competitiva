# Solução

1. Código:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int D) {
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
        while(left < right) {
            int middle = left+(right-left)/2;
            if(requiredDays(weights, middle) <= D)
                right = middle;
            else
                left = middle+1;
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    int requiredDays(vector<int>& weights, int shipCapacity) {
        int days = 0, acc_sum = 0;
        for(int weight : weights) {
            acc_sum += weight;
            if(acc_sum > shipCapacity) {
                acc_sum = weight;
                days++;
            }
        }
        if(acc_sum != 0)
            days++;

        return days;
    }
};
